Clojure Katas
=============

These katas are sword exercises that will make you one with your editor and environment. The artist and the brush moving as a single tool. The exercises are not hard, that's not the point. The point is to code like the wind.


Practice daily to commit your clojure workflow to muscle memory. 

TODO
----
- [ ] move user functions out of core
- [ ] move functional redefinition exercises to functional.cljs
- [ ] add easier exercises, like palandrome, simple filter, simple map problems
- [ ] setup nrepl
- [ ] deftest cards are a great start, but I also want people to learn the clojure test suite and build the muscle memory of using their own editor to test :thinking:.
